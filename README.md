# TYPO3 CMS distribution for testing my extensions

This is a TYPO3 distribution which I use to manually test my extensions:

- [feuserextrafields](https://github.com/oliverklee-de/feuserextrafields)
- [oelib](https://github.com/oliverklee-de/oelib)
- [onetimeaccount](https://github.com/oliverklee-de/onetimeaccount)
- [seminars](https://github.com/oliverklee-de/seminars)
- [tea](https://github.com/TYPO3BestPractices/tea)

## Usage

This distribution uses [ddev](https://github.com/drud/ddev).

### Initializing the project

```bash
ddev start
ddev composer install
ddev install-typo3
```

### Database dump and import

There are two commands available for dumping the database and for importing the
dump to and from the file `dump.sql`:

```bash
ddev db-dump
ddev db-import
```

The dump includes (and hence overwrite on import) FE users and FE user groups,
but not BE users or BE user groups. (So it is safe to add BE users and then
run the import.)

### Developing and testing extensions

To test a local development copies of extension in this distribution:

1. Copy the file `.ddev/docker-compose.packages.yaml.template` to
   `.ddev/docker-compose.packages.yaml`.
2. Modify the left-handside paths to match the directories of the extensions
   on your host machine.
3. Add other extensions as needed.
